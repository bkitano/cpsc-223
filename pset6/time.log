I worked with:
David Schwartz

Discussion:
The hardest part was most certainly implementing the
bfs and ofs without dumb errors from copy and pasting.
One of the trickier parts was handling the sorting for
ofs, but David suggested the elegant solution of using
a struct and qsort, rather than having to implement
qsort on my own.
