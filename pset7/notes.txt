if the game has ended up with the state where there are 2 brownines in the lsast three columns, you represent it as 222
you know the rmaining brownies have to be at the bottom of the board
we'll hust work wt hstrings of digits and you also know that there will neber be a pan of brownies with more than 9 brownies
per column

so lets say we have a pan 222

we get a list of all of the states

record 000 as W (win)

000 W
100 L
110 W
111 W
200 W
210 -> 110 or 200 or 000 which are all wins, so it's an L
211 -> 210 is a loss, so this is a W
220 
221
222

for each state s in list
    get list of usccessor states (chomp_successors) (number of successor states is the total number of brownies)
        if all successor statest are wins
            record s as a loss
        else record s as a win

look at 100
the only move we can do is go to 000
so since all the moves after 100 are wins, 100 is a loss

Need to keep recursing down once you've gone all the way left
