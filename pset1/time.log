I discussed my solution with: David Schwartz, Noah Ritz, Clayton Skoda.

Doing this pset without a written down Finite State Machine was essentially
impossible; taking the time to write out the states was critical. I had trouble
utilizing the logic of 'peekchar', which is referenced in the book at first, but 
now see the reason for its importance.
