I discussed my solution with: David Schwartz, Noah Ritz, and Clay Skoda.

The hard parts were 
- determining the contents of each struct
- the process of instantiating each struct
- clearing memory leaks, and
- making it adaptable to weird inputs.

The major breakthroughs were in realizing that you could use multiple hash
tables to do basic functions in constant time. I also learned that I shouldn't
fixate on how far behind I am compared to the people that I work with, because
then the homework turns from a fun challenge to a hopeless struggle. I ended up
finishing most of the pset by myself, which was definitely helpful in terms of 
psychological performance.
