Missing children (and the empty tree) are represented by null pointers. 
Typically, individual tree nodes are allocated separately using malloc; 
however, for high-performance use it is not unusual for tree libraries 
to do their own storage allocation out of large blocks obtained from 
malloc.

Node functions are local to
isset.c, and not accessible
in other files.
