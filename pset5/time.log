ESTIMATE: 20 hours
November 1: Wrote starter code
Novmeber 11: getHeight working (3 hours)
November 11: added a rotator (3 hours)
November 13: draft of remove (5 hours)
November 14: added delete node (3 hours)
November 14: fixed deleteNode (2 hours)
November 14: fixed invalid reads (1 hour)
November 15: fixed rotations (3 hours)
TOTAL: 20 hours

I consulted:
David Schwartz
Noah Ritz
Kanniel Yao
Gigi Stark

Problems:
1. Rotating - I think rotating was difficult for me to implement because I didn't 
realize the complexity of the actual algorithm until it was very late in the deadline.
I know understand the importance of starting early, and thank God for late days. Aspnes
implements it in the notes using double pointers, and that held me up for a long time,
so I ended up having to get help to implement it with single pointers.

2. Merging - Merging had a lot of special cases, and I was not privy to the insight
required to see that. I am grateful to the people who helped me work the cases out.

3. Pointers - double pointers are hard.
