Biggest Challenge: I read the specs wrong, so I had to throw away a significant
portion code. I estimate that this would have taken 12 hours had I not made such
a significant blunder. In addition, I found a lot of mistakes were due to not 
reading the library function usage instructions, which I will do more carefully
in the future.
